## Architectural Decisions

Within this project we keep an architectural decision log as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and these decisions are stored in the [within the docs directory](doc/adr).

When making an architecturally significant decision for the project please ensure that it is documented in the directory. You may find it useful to use Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to help manage your interactions with these.
